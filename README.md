# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game


Welcome to my Tic Tac Toe game! This project is a classic implementation of the popular game using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows two players to compete against each other, taking turns to mark spaces in a 3x3 grid. The first player to align three of their marks vertically, horizontally, or diagonally wins the game.

Two-Player Mode: Players take turns to place their marks (X or O) on the game board.
Winner Detection: The game automatically detects the winner and displays a congratulatory message.
Draw Detection: If all spaces are filled and no player has won, the game declares a draw.
Responsive Design: The game is responsive and can be played on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.
Technologies Used
HTML: For the structure of the game.
CSS: For styling and layout.
JavaScript: For game logic and interactivity.
